# TODO: replace the behavior of main (and gen_sqlite) with some prompts here that
# - let you fetch from various configured sources, specifying a dir
# - let you transform to frequency in the db
# - let you generate a sqlite file
# all as consecutive options you can pick, or
# - separately, let you postprocess pluralkit data, when that's implemented
